#You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:
Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

->  Select N, Case When P is NULL Then 'Root' When N in (Select B1.P From BST B1 JOIN BST B2 ON B1.P=B2.N ) Then 'Inner' ELSE 'Leaf' End as Node From BST Order By N
